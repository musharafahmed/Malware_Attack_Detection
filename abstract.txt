Abstract
Malicious URLs host various unsolicited content and can pose a high
threat to potential victims. Therefore, a fast and efficient detection
technique is needed. In this thesis, we focus on the problem of detecting malicious URLs based on the information obtained from URLs
using machine-learning technologies. We proceeded in two steps.
First, we created and implemented a tool that extracts, processes,
and store the URL features in such a way that machine-learning models can be trained on them. Second, we trained and evaluated models
created with SVMlight and TensorFlow libraries on a real-life dataset
of malicious and benign URLs, provided by ESET company. The efficiency and accuracy of the prediction of these models are measured
and compared. The results are showing the ability and suitability of
tested technologies to predict the probability of a URL being malicious.
